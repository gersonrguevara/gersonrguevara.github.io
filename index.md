#### Research Agenda
Hello! I am a fifth year doctoral candidate (ABD) at Michigan State University in the Department of Political Science. I study American politics and research methods with a focus on race and ethnic politics and Latino/a/x politics. 

My research is particularly interested in examining the construction of Latino identity and its impacts on political attitudes and behavior. My dissertation project investigates what components of Latino identity foster intra- and inter-group coherence through the application of computational methods to both survey and text data.

#### Short Biography
I am originally from the DC-metro area and studied at Jackson State University at the undergraduate level. Outside of teaching and research I enjoy spending time with friends and family, hiking,  watching movies, and playing video games.
